The past couple of months have been an exciting time for the Data Science

Group Working Group (DWSG). The group, which started in January, brings together

both professional data scientists and data enthusiasts hoping to improve their skills

whilst making an impact. DSWG uses the wealth of open source data made available

by SF Open Data and others to work on both its own projects as well as to support

other civic hackers at Code for San Francisco. By providing data science expertise

they’ve become a central resource to the broader SF Brigade.

One project that the DSWG is currently working on is SF Open Data’s 311

case dataset to understand what agencies tend to respond first, which

neighborhoods are served first and what their most common problems are. Another

example is ImpactGov, a project aiming to measure the impact of government-

funded activities in the Bay Area. The goal of the SF Environment Benchmark

project is to visualize building energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in

order to encourage building owners and managers to make changes.

Sounds interesting? If you want to join our projects, have a problem that big data

can help you solve, or want to use or develop your data skills and make a difference,

come see us! We meet every Wednesday during Civic Hack Night.

Stay tuned to learn more about our findings!
